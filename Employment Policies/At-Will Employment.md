# At-Will Employment Policy

Your employment with RxJet is a voluntary one and is subject to 
termination by you or RxJet at will, with or without 
cause, and with or without notice, at any time. Nothing in these 
policies shall be interpreted to be in conflict with or to eliminate 
or modify in any way the employment-at-will status of RxJet employees.

This policy of employment-at-will may not be modified by any 
officer or employee and shall not be modified in any publication or 
document. The only exception to this policy is a written employment 
agreement approved at the discretion of the President or the Board 
of Directors, whichever is applicable.

These personnel policies are not intended to be a contract of employment 
or a legal document.
