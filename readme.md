# Our Handbook

At RxJet Incorporated we're working on building a value-driven culture.  This repository contains all of the policies that we use at RxJet.

This repository contains only general information and guidelines. It is not intended to be comprehensive 
or the to address every conceivable situation that may occur.  For that reason, if you have any questions 
regarding the eligibility for a particular benefit or applicability of a policy or practice to you, you 
should address your questions directly to the President of the company.

Neither this handbook nor any other company document confers any contractural right, either 
express or implied, to remain in the company's employ.  Nor does it guarantee any fixed terms 
and conditions of your employment.
